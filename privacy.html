    <h1>Dork Filtertron - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: [Date]</p>
    <p>
        This privacy policy outlines how the Dork Filtertron Chrome Extension (“Extension”) handles user data.
        By installing and using the Extension, you agree to the practices described below.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Dork Filtertron is designed to streamline search capabilities and manage prompt-related settings 
        without collecting or sharing your personal information. We strive to uphold user privacy and abide 
        by all relevant Google Chrome developer policies.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>No Personal Data Collected:</strong> The Extension does not collect or transmit any personally 
        identifiable information (“PII”). This includes, but is not limited to, names, addresses, email 
        addresses, or any form of user authentication data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Search & Browsing Activity:</strong> We do not access or store your search terms, browsing 
        history, or personal communications. The Extension only identifies which domain you are currently 
        on (e.g., google.com, bing.com) to provide relevant filters or functionality. 
    </p>

    <h2>3. Local Storage & Chrome Sync</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Settings and Prompts:</strong> Your filter preferences, prompts, and advanced search queries 
        may be stored locally using Chrome’s built-in storage (including Chrome Sync). This allows you to 
        retain your customized settings across browsing sessions and, if you choose, sync them to other 
        devices where you’re signed in with the same Google account.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>No External Transmission:</strong> None of your locally stored settings or prompts are 
        transmitted to any external server. All data remains within your device or within the Chrome Sync 
        environment, which is governed by Google’s privacy protocols.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The Extension does not use analytics providers, ad networks, or any third-party tracking mechanisms. 
        It operates solely within your browser to enhance your existing web searches and prompt management.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or transfer user data to third parties. Because no personal data is 
        collected, there is nothing to share. We do not use or transfer any data to determine creditworthiness 
        or for lending purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Minimized Risks:</strong> Since the Extension does not transmit data to external servers, 
        it substantially reduces the risk of a data breach. Your browser-based settings remain private and 
        under your control at all times.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Compliance with Policies</h2>
    <p>
        We certify that we:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not sell or transfer user data to third parties, outside of the approved use cases.</li>
        <li>Do not use or transfer user data for purposes unrelated to the Extension’s single purpose.</li>
        <li>Do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. Your 
        continued use of the Extension after any modifications indicates your acceptance of those changes.
    </p>
