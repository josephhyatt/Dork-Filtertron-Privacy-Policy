    <h1>Dork Filtertron - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: [Date]</p>
    <p>
        This privacy policy outlines how the Dork Filtertron Chrome Extension (“Extension”) handles user data.
        By installing and using the Extension, you agree to the practices described below.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        The Extension does not collect any personally identifiable information. We do not record, store,
        or send any personal data, search terms, or browsing history to external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Storage of Settings</h2>
    <p>
        Any user preferences or filter settings are stored locally in your browser's storage.
        These settings do not leave your device and are not transmitted to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The Extension does not integrate with any analytics providers or ad networks. It operates solely
        within your browser and applies filters directly to supported search engines.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or transfer user data to any third parties.
        Since no personal data is collected, there is nothing to share.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        As the Extension does not transfer data beyond your device, the risk of data breach is minimized.
        Your settings remain private and under your control at all times.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
        Your continued use of the Extension after any modifications indicates your acceptance of those changes.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please reach out at
