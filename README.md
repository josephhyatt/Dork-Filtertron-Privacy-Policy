# Dork Filtertron

**Dork Filtertron** is a Chrome extension designed to streamline search efficiency across multiple search engines. It provides quick access to time-based search filters for Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, and offers an advanced dorking interface for custom operators on supported engines such as GitHub and YouTube.

## Features

- **Time Filters:** Easily apply filters like past hour, day, week, month, or year on supported search engines.
- **GitHub-Specific Filters:** Quickly refine GitHub results by language, open/closed status, issues/PRs, and custom date ranges.
- **Advanced Search (Dorking):** Use a variety of search operators (dorks) to construct precise queries. Supports standard operators (like `site:` or `filetype:`) and engine-specific modifiers.
- **Undo Changes:** Revert to original search results without applied filters.
- **Preview Advanced Queries:** See the full URL before navigating, ensuring clarity and correctness of complex queries.

## How It Works

1. **Basic Filters:** In the "Search Filters" tab, select your preferred search engine, then choose a time-based filter. For GitHub, apply language filters or quick filters (open/closed issues, PRs) and even set advanced date ranges.
2. **Advanced Dorking:** In the "Advanced Search" tab, pick an engine, a dork category, and a method. Add parameters and extra query terms, preview the resulting URL, and open it in a new tab.
3. **Undo:** Quickly remove applied filters to return to original search results.

## Installation

1. Download the extension from the Chrome Web Store.
2. Once installed, pin the extension icon to your Chrome toolbar.
3. Click the icon to open the popup and start filtering!
